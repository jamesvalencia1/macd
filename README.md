# Moving Average Convergence / Divergence (MACD)

For those who wish to create a MACD graph in Python coding, I did a simple update to a code created by Andrew Hamlet here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/python-tutorial-macd-moving-average-andrew-hamlet/

His code became outdated when Yahoo updated their API and pandas.io.data was moved. I've created an updated code (as of June 28, 2018) using a few modules listed below.
# Python Modules Used
The following modules should be installed in order to use the code
* iexfinance
* matplotlib
* pandas
* datetime

# File
* [macd.py](https://github.com/jamesvalencia1/macd/blob/master/macd.py)
